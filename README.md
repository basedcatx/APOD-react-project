# NASA APOD Project ðŸŒŒ

This project is a **React** application that showcases NASA's **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)** using the [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/). Each day, the app fetches and displays a new image with accompanying details, allowing users to explore and learn something new about the universe daily.

## Features

- **Daily Astronomy Image**: Automatically loads and displays the APOD image for the current day.
- **Image Details**: Shows title, description, and date for each APOD image.
- **Date Picker for Past Images**: Users can select any date to view previous APOD images.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with responsive styles to work seamlessly across devices.
- **Error Handling**: Displays friendly error messages if there's an issue fetching data or if an invalid date is selected.
